A Comparative Study of Machine Learning Algorithms for Fake News Detection

This study presents an approach to detecting fake news articles, a pervasive issue in the age of digital information. By leveraging a diverse dataset of news articles, the study employs a combination of text preprocessing techniques and classification algorithms to discern authentic news from fabricated or misleading content. Text preprocessing includes lowercasing, tokenization, and stop word removal, followed by feature extraction using TF-IDF with n-grams (1 to 3 words). Three machine learning algorithms, namely Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naive Bayes classifier, and Passive Aggressive classifier, were employed for classification. This study compares the performance of these algorithms and draws insights regarding their effectiveness. The findings of this study indicate promising results in fake news detection. The performances were evaluated on validation set and unseen data separately. The Linear SVM model achieved an accuracy of 92.1\%, while the Passive Aggressive classifier demonstrated 90.8\% accuracy, and the Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier achieved 88.3\% on validation set. These results underscore the effectiveness of machine learning in identifying potentially unreliable news articles. Despite these encouraging results, our study acknowledges several limitations. The dataset's potential biases, subjective labeling, and the absence of real-time updates are notable concerns. This research contributes to the ongoing efforts to combat the spread of fake news, offering an automated solution that can assist in identifying suspicious articles. While the achieved accuracies are promising, further exploration of diverse datasets, advanced feature extraction techniques, and consideration of ethical aspects remains crucial to enhancing the reliability of fake news detection systems.
